This is a proof of concept visualization tool for aquery.
We use the q-R interface to query a q process from an R server that executes
a shiny (simple web browser) application. Plotting is done with the elegant
R ggplot2 library.
     
Every query in an aquery file is wrapped and stored for reexecution at command
under a function in the .aq namespace. The first query is wrapped in .aq.q0, the second
in .aq.q1 and so on.
 
To visualize a particular query simply call .aq.qx from the R program's browser
interface.
 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
If you're missing any dependencies, it mis a good idea to call
`make install`

which installs R packages and compiles the q server code (for use in R)

`make` : `make install` + compiling aquery compiler


Once you have everything set up, you can call a simple proof of concept
which compiles a trivial query (poc.a) and serves the browser application
by calling
`./run_poc.sh my_port` where you replace the my_port with the port number you 
would like to assign to the q program
