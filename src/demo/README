This is a simple demo folder for aquery (sequential version).

In order to run the fintime examples:
1 - make fintime
2 - make
3 - cd examples; q compiled_fintime.q

In order to run end-of-day examples:
1 - call make
2 - cd exammples; q compiled_eod.q


Note that you must have the q executable in your $PATH. If you don't, please visit
the kx site to download (https://kx.com/software-download.php)

All data generated (along with q serialized tables) are found in the data/ folder.
Building the fintime examples takes a bit longer, as the data is randomly generated
and not attached here to minimize size.

If you'd like to compile your own examples, make sure to have a2q (the aquery 
compiler executable) in your path. You can check the options as usual with a2q -help

This has been tested to run on Mac OSX and linux. This is unlikely to port without
modifications to windows.

The a2qinterpret program uses Matt Warren's qPy to communicate with a q server. We leverage
his kdb.py code. It has been tested to work with python 2.7.*

If you are interested in running the examples in examples/, note that various
data loads take place with relative paths (relative to that folder), so please call

cd examples/; ../a2qinterpret.sh <your-port-here>

to make sure all filesystem paths work as intended.

If you have any issues or questions, please email Jos√© Cambronero (jpc48@cs.nyu.edu)
