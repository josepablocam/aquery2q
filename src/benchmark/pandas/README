This runs a subset of the operations that pandas uses
in their vbench historical benchmarking. We pick operations
that are interesting use cases for aquery (furthermore,
we picked these prior to running any kind of experiments,
so the choices are NOT tailored towards performance in any way).



To reproduce:
1 - call `make` from the src directory.
    
Finally, you can run the experiments with
./run_benchmark.sh your_csv_path_for_results.csv per_query_iterations \
  benchmark_iterations benchmark_size
  

Note that you should provide an absolute path for outputting results, as the script
changes directories during execution.
