This runs the quantile computation benchmark referenced at
https://www.monetdb.org/blog/embedded-pythonnumpy-monetdb

We use numpy for the monetdb+embedded python version
and a version implemented in aquery for the aquery benchmark


To reproduce:
1 - call `make` from the src directory.
    
Finally, you can run the experiments with
./run_benchmark.sh your_csv_path_for_results.csv per_query_iterations \
  benchmark_iterations benchmark_size
  

Note that you should provide an absolute path for outputting results, as the script
changes directories during execution.
