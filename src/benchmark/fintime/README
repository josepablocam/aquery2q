This benchmark runs the historical queries that are part of 

http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/fintime.html


To reproduce:
1 - call `make` from the src directory.
  cd src/
  a) to build the default data (2000 stock ids, 4000 days):
     make
  b) to build with arbitrary # of stock ids
    export BENCHMARKSIZE=n
    make
    
Finally, you can run the experiments with
./run_benchmark.sh your_csv_path_for_results.csv per_query_iterations benchmark_iterations

Note that you should provide an absolute path for outputting results, as the script
changes directories during execution.
