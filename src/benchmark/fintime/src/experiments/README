Preliminary results from the fintime benchmarking process 

To reproduce, create the historical data necessary using the code at http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/fintime.d/gen.html
Steps
1 - call `make` in the directory with the C++ code available above
2 - call `./histgen 5000` to generate a history of 5000 securities, with the default 4000 days
3 - move the files generated to /Users/josecambronero/MS/S15/aquery/src/benchmark/fintime/data

Finally, you can run the experiments with

./run_benchmark.sh your_csv_path_for_results.csv per_query_iterations benchmark_iterations
