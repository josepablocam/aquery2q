Preliminary results from the fintime benchmarking process (modified currently)

To reproduce, create the historical data necessary using the code at http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/fintime.d/gen.html
Steps
1 - call `make` in the directory with the C++ code available above
2 - call `./histgen 5000` to generate a history of 5000 securities, with the default 4000 days
3 - move the files generated to this folder

To create the databases (the files above are pipe delimited)
run
`q make_dbs.q`

Finally, you can run the experiments with
`./run_benchmark.sh`, which performs aquery compilation and runs the 2 examples. The first set of results correspond to equivalence verification (are the aquery and q results equal?), the second set are aquery run times, and the final are q runtimes.
