/***Operations
Local temporary averages:
1 - Group Ticks by ID (group-by is order independent)
2 - Within each group, sort: date and price by ASC ID, ASC timestamp (order-dependent operations in project clause)
3 - Project ID, date, avgs(21, price), avgs(5, price)
4 - Update order info for averages table in symbol table

Main query:
1 - Acknowledge that the order clause is already fulfilled by the averages table, so eliminate sorting
2 - Flatten averages
3 - Filter on a21 > a5 AND prev(a21) <= prev(a5) AND prev(ID) = ID
4 - Project ID, date
